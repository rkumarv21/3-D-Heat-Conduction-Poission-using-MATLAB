# 3-D-Heat-Conduction-Poission-using-MATLAB
This project is to be done under Prof. Malay k. Das, Mechanical Engg(IITK).
First Step was to Non-dimensionalize the general equation and boundary conditions.
Then Discretised the general equation and boundary conditions using Crank Nicolson approach.
Application of MATLAB to create a program solve the 3-D poisson equation for temperature distribution.
